# Tales From The Cryptocurrency

Tales from the Cryptocurrency is a app that allows you to monitor the changes in various cryptocurrencies. The volatility in cryptocurrency prices makes closely monitoring their changes important. 

Built using the cryptocompare API to pull the necessary information to populate the tables. Over 50 cryptocurrencies are available for users to create a personalized watchlist for their investment needs. 

Tales from the Cryptocurrency was created to make buying cryptocurrencies less of unmanageable task to people that are not well versed in markets, but does not overwhelm the user with information.
